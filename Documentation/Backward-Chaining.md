The `BackwardChaining` class is a Python class that contains two static methods: `check` and `BC`. The purpose of this class is to implement the backward chaining algorithm for checking if a given query `q` is entailed by a given knowledge base `KB`.

The `check` method takes in two arguments: `KB` and `q`. `KB` is a list of strings representing the clauses in the knowledge base. Each clause can either be a fact (e.g., `"A"`) or an implication (e.g., `"A & B => C"`). `q` is a list containing a single string representing the query.

The method starts by initializing two data structures: a dictionary called `inferred` and a list called `entailed`. The `inferred` dictionary maps each symbol in the knowledge base to a boolean value indicating whether it has been inferred to be true or not. The `entailed` list will contain the symbols that are entailed by the knowledge base in the order in which they were inferred.

Next, the method calls the recursive `BC` method with the knowledge base, query, inferred dictionary, and entailed list as arguments. The result of this call is stored in a variable called `result`.

If `result` is `True`, then this means that the query is entailed by the knowledge base. In this case, the method returns a string `"YES"` followed by a comma-separated list of the symbols in the `entailed` list. If `result` is `False`, then this means that the query is not entailed by the knowledge base. In this case, the method returns `"NO"`.

The `BC` method takes in four arguments: `KB`, `q`, `inferred`, and `entailed`. This method implements the recursive backward chaining algorithm. It starts by checking if the query symbol `q` is already known to be true (i.e., if it is present in the `inferred` dictionary with a value of `True`). If it is, then the method immediately returns `True`.

If the query symbol is not already known to be true, then the method proceeds to find all implications in the knowledge base that have `q` as their conclusion. For each such implication, it splits it into its premise and conclusion parts and checks if all premises are true. It does this by recursively calling itself on each premise symbol.

If all premises of an implication are found to be true, then this means that its conclusion (i.e., the query symbol) can be inferred to be true. In this case, the method adds the query symbol to the `entailed` list, marks it as inferred in the `inferred` dictionary, and returns `True`.

If none of the implications with `q` as their conclusion have all their premises true, then this means that `q` cannot be inferred to be true from the knowledge base. In this case, the method returns `False`.

In summary, this class implements a simple backward chaining algorithm for checking if a given query is entailed by a given knowledge base. It does this by recursively checking if all premises of implications with the query as their conclusion are true. If they are, then it infers that the query is also true and adds it to an entailed list. Finally, it returns whether or not the query was entailed along with a list of all symbols that were entailed by the knowledge base.
