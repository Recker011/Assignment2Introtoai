The Rete algorithm is designed to work with propositional logic in a rule-based format, where the knowledge base (KB) is represented as a set of rules and facts. The example Knowledge Base provided represents the KB and query in a different format, using logical operators such as `&` (and), `|` (or), and `~` (not) to represent the relationships between propositions.

To use the Rete algorithm with a KB and query in this format, it is needed to first convert them into a rule-based format that the Rete algorithm can work with. This can be done by converting the logical expressions into conjunctive normal form (CNF) and then representing each conjunct as a rule.

For example, the KB provided can be converted into CNF as follows:

```
KB = '((~a & c) | (~c & a) | (~d & c) | (~d & a)) & ((~a & d) | (~c & d) | (~c & a) | (~d & a))'
   = '((~a | ~c | ~d | ~d) & (c | a | c | a)) & ((~a | ~c | ~c | ~d) & (d | d | a | a))'
   = '(~a | ~c | ~d) & (c | a) & (~a | ~c | ~d) & (d | a)'
```

This CNF expression can then be represented as a set of rules in the following way:

```
KB = ['a|c|d=>f1', 'f1&a=>f2', 'f2&b=>f3', 'f3&c=>f4', 'f4&d=>f5']
```

where `f1`, `f2`, `f3`, `f4`, and `f5` are new propositions introduced to represent intermediate results.

Similarly, the query provided can be converted into CNF as follows:

```
query = '~d & (~g | ~f)'
     = '~d & ~g & ~f'
```

This CNF expression can then be represented as a set of queries in the following way:

```
query = ['~d', '~g', '~f']
```

Once the KB and query have been converted into a rule-based format, the Rete algorithm can be used to check if the query can be entailed from the KB.
