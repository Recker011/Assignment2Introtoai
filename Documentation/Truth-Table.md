# TruthTable Implementation

```python
import re

class TruthTable:

    @staticmethod
    def check(kb, query):
        symbols = list(set(re.findall(r'[a-z]+[0-9]*', kb + query)))
        def evaluate(expression, values):
            for s in symbols:
                expression = expression.replace(s, str(values[s]))
            return eval(expression)
        models = 0
        for i in range(2**len(symbols)):
            values = {symbols[j]: (i >> j) & 1 for j in range(len(symbols))}
            if evaluate(kb, values):
                if evaluate(query, values):
                    models += 1
                else:
                    return 'NO'
        return f'YES:{models}'
```

The `TruthTable` class is a Python class that contains a single static method `check` which takes in two arguments: `kb` and `query`. The purpose of this method is to check if the given `query` is true in all models of the given knowledge base `kb`.

## Method: check

```python
@staticmethod
def check(kb, query):
```

### Arguments

- `kb`: A string representing the knowledge base. This should be a logical expression using Python's logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`) and parentheses to group subexpressions.
- `query`: A string representing the query. This should also be a logical expression using Python's logical operators and parentheses.

### Description

The method starts by extracting all the symbols from the `kb` and `query` strings using a regular expression. These symbols are stored in a list called `symbols`.

```python
symbols = list(set(re.findall(r'[a-z]+[0-9]*', kb + query)))
```

Next, the method defines an inner function called `evaluate` which takes in two arguments: `expression` and `values`. This function is used to evaluate a given logical expression with the given values for the symbols. It does this by replacing all occurrences of the symbols in the expression with their corresponding values and then using Python's built-in `eval` function to evaluate the resulting expression.

```python
def evaluate(expression, values):
    for s in symbols:
        expression = expression.replace(s, str(values[s]))
    return eval(expression)
```

After defining the `evaluate` function, the method proceeds to generate all possible models (i.e., assignments of truth values to the symbols) using a for loop that iterates over the range from 0 to 2^n, where n is the number of symbols. For each iteration, a dictionary called `values` is created that maps each symbol to its truth value (0 or 1) based on the current iteration number.

```python
models = 0
for i in range(2**len(symbols)):
    values = {symbols[j]: (i >> j) & 1 for j in range(len(symbols))}
```

The method then uses the `evaluate` function to check if the knowledge base `kb` is true under the current model (i.e., assignment of truth values to symbols). If it is, then it checks if the query is also true under this model. If it is, then it increments a counter variable called `models`. If it is not, then it immediately returns 'NO' since this means that there exists a model in which the knowledge base is true but the query is false.

```python
if evaluate(kb, values):
    if evaluate(query, values):
        models += 1
    else:
        return 'NO'
```

After checking all possible models, if none of them caused an early return of 'NO', then the method returns 'YES' along with the number of models in which both the knowledge base and query are true.

```python
return f'YES:{models}'
```

### Summary

In summary, this code implements a simple algorithm for checking if a given query is a logical consequence of a given knowledge base using truth tables. It does this by generating all possible models (assignments of truth values to symbols) and checking if the query is true in all models in which the knowledge base is true. If it is, then it returns 'YES' along with the number of such models. Otherwise, it returns 'NO'.
