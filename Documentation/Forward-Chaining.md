# Explanation of the Forward Chaining Implementation

The `ForwardChaining` class is an implementation of a forward chaining algorithm for checking if a given `query` can be inferred from a given knowledge base `kb`. The class contains a single method, `check`, which takes two arguments: `kb`, which represents a knowledge base in the form of a list of strings representing facts and rules; and `q`, which represents a query in the form of a list containing a single string representing a fact to be checked.

```python
class ForwardChaining:
    @staticmethod
    def check(kb, q):
        # Initialize the count of premises for each implication
        count = {}
        # Initialize the inferred dictionary
        inferred = {}
        # Initialize the agenda with known facts
        agenda = []
        for clause in kb:
            # Check if the clause is an implication
            if "=>" in clause:
                # Split the clause into premise and conclusion
                premise, conclusion = clause.split("=>")
                # Count the number of premises
                count[conclusion.strip()] = len(premise.split("&"))
                inferred[conclusion.strip()] = False
            else:
                # Add the fact to the agenda
                agenda.append(clause.strip())
                inferred[clause.strip()] = True
        # Initialize the entailed list
        entailed = []
        while agenda:
            # Pop the first symbol from the agenda
            p = agenda.pop(0)
            # Add the symbol to the entailed list
            entailed.append(p)
            # Check if the symbol is the query
            if p == q[0]:
                return "YES: " + ", ".join(entailed)  # outputs YES and order of entailed facts
            # For each implication in the kb
            for clause in kb:
                if "=>" in clause:
                    premise, conclusion = clause.split("=>")
                    # If p is one of the premises
                    if p in premise.split("&"):
                        # Decrease the count of premises for this implication
                        count[conclusion.strip()] -= 1
                        # If all premises are true
                        if count[conclusion.strip()] == 0:
                            # Add the conclusion to the agenda
                            if not inferred[conclusion.strip()]:
                                agenda.append(conclusion.strip())
                                inferred[conclusion.strip()] = True
        return "NO"
```

The `check` method initializes three variables: `count`, which is a dictionary that keeps track of the number of premises for each implication in the knowledge base; `inferred`, which is a dictionary that keeps track of which facts have been inferred; and `agenda`, which is a list containing all known facts (i.e., strings that do not contain an implication symbol) from the knowledge base.

The method then enters a loop that continues until there are no more elements in the `agenda`. In each iteration of the loop, it pops the first element from the `agenda` and assigns it to variable `p`. It then checks if `p` matches the query (i.e., if it is equal to the first element of the `q` list) and, if it does, appends it to the list of entailed facts and returns `'YES'` along with those entailed facts.

If `p` does not match the query, it is added to the dictionary of inferred facts with a value of `True`. The method then loops over all implications in the knowledge base and checks their premises by splitting them at any conjunction symbols (`'&'`). If all premises are inferred (i.e., present in the `inferred` dictionary with a value of `True`), it decreases their count in the `count` dictionary. If all premises for an implication are satisfied (i.e., if its count reaches 0), its conclusion is added to the `agenda` if it has not already been inferred.

If the loop completes without finding a match for the query, the method returns `'NO'`.

This implementation of the forward chaining algorithm uses dictionaries to keep track of satisfied rules and inferred facts and loops over all implications in the knowledge base in each iteration of its main loop to check their premises and conclusions. It infers new facts from the given knowledge base until either the query is found or there are no more facts to infer. If the query is found, it returns `'YES'` along with the entailed facts; otherwise, it returns `'NO'`.
