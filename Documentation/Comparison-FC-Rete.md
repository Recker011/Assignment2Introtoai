# Differences between the Rete and Forward Chaining Implementations

The `Rete` and `ForwardChaining` classes are two different implementations of forward chaining algorithms for checking if a given query can be inferred from a given knowledge base. The main difference between these two implementations is the way they keep track of which rules have been satisfied and which facts have been inferred.

## The Rete Implementation

```python
class Rete:
    @staticmethod
    def check(KB, query):
        # Initialize agenda with facts from KB
        agenda = [fact for fact in KB if Rete.is_fact(fact)]
        inferred = {}
        entailed_facts = []

        while agenda:
            p = agenda.pop(0)

            # If p matches the query, return YES with entailed facts
            if p == query[0]:
                entailed_facts.append(p)
                return f'YES: {", ".join(entailed_facts)}'

            inferred[p] = True

            for fact in KB:
                premises = Rete.entails(fact)
                # If all premises are inferred, add the implication to entailed facts and agenda
                if all(inferred.get(premise) for premise in premises):
                    q = Rete.implies(fact)
                    if q and not inferred.get(q):
                        entailed_facts.append(q)
                        agenda.append(q)
        return 'NO'
```

In the `Rete` implementation, the `check` method initializes an `agenda` list with known facts from the knowledge base and an `inferred` dictionary to keep track of which facts have been inferred. The method then enters a loop that continues until there are no more elements in the `agenda`. In each iteration of the loop, it pops the first element from the `agenda`, checks if it matches the query, and adds it to the dictionary of inferred facts if it does not.

The method then loops over all facts in the knowledge base and checks their premises using the previously defined `entails` method. If all premises are inferred (i.e., present in the `inferred` dictionary with a value of `True`), it checks the implication using the previously defined `implies` method and adds its conclusion to the list of entailed facts and the `agenda` if it has not already been inferred.

If the loop completes without finding a match for the query, the method returns `'NO'`.

## The Forward Chaining Implementation

```python
class ForwardChaining:
    @staticmethod
    def check(kb, q):
        # Initialize the count of premises for each implication
        count = {}
        # Initialize the inferred dictionary
        inferred = {}
        # Initialize the agenda with known facts
        agenda = []
        for clause in kb:
            # Check if the clause is an implication
            if "=>" in clause:
                # Split the clause into premise and conclusion
                premise, conclusion = clause.split("=>")
                # Count the number of premises
                count[conclusion.strip()] = len(premise.split("&"))
                inferred[conclusion.strip()] = False
            else:
                # Add the fact to the agenda
                agenda.append(clause.strip())
                inferred[clause.strip()] = True
        # Initialize the entailed list
        entailed = []
        while agenda:
            # Pop the first symbol from the agenda
            p = agenda.pop(0)
            # Add the symbol to the entailed list
            entailed.append(p)
            # Check if the symbol is the query
            if p == q[0]:
                return "YES: " + ", ".join(entailed)  # outputs YES and order of entailed facts
            # For each implication in the kb
            for clause in kb:
                if "=>" in clause:
                    premise, conclusion = clause.split("=>")
                    # If p is one of the premises
                    if p in premise.split("&"):
                        # Decrease the count of premises for this implication
                        count[conclusion.strip()] -= 1
                        # If all premises are true
                        if count[conclusion.strip()] == 0:
                            # Add the conclusion to the agenda
                            if not inferred[conclusion.strip()]:
                                agenda.append(conclusion.strip())
                                inferred[conclusion.strip()] = True
        return "NO"
```

        
In the `ForwardChaining` implementation, the `check` method initializes a `count` dictionary to keep track of the number of premises for each implication in the knowledge base, an `inferred` dictionary to keep track of which facts have been inferred, and an `agenda` list with known facts from the knowledge base. The method then enters a loop that continues until there are no more elements in the `agenda`. In each iteration of the loop, it pops the first element from the `agenda`, adds it to the list of entailed facts, and checks if it matches the query.

If the popped element does not match the query, the method loops over all implications in the knowledge base and checks if the popped element is one of their premises. If it is, it decreases the count of premises for that implication in the `count` dictionary. If all premises for that implication are satisfied (i.e., if its count reaches 0), its conclusion is added to the `agenda` if it has not already been inferred.

If the loop completes without finding a match for the query, the method returns `'NO'`.

## Comparison

In comparison to each other, these two implementations differ in how they keep track of satisfied rules and inferred facts. The `Rete` implementation uses an `inferred` dictionary and loops over all facts in the knowledge base in each iteration of its main loop to check their premises and implications. The `ForwardChaining` implementation uses both a `count` dictionary to keep track of the number of premises for each implication and an `inferred` dictionary to keep track of which facts have been inferred. It also loops over all implications in the knowledge base in each iteration of its main loop to check their premises and conclusions.

Both implementations use forward chaining to infer new facts from a given knowledge base until either the query is found or there are no more facts to infer. If the query is found, they return `'YES'` along with the entailed facts; otherwise, they return `'NO'`.
